##BULLY
got bullied at school today. Some classmates were laughing at me in the hallway. I tried to ignore it, but it really hurt my feelings. During lunch, I stayed by myself. On the way home, I kept thinking about what happened. It made me feel lonely and upset for the rest of the day.


##JOB
I got a job offer today. I have been waiting for this opportunity for weeks. I spent the morning checking my email constantly. When I saw the message, I smiled and told my family. I spent the afternoon planning how to start this new chapter. Everything feels exciting and new.
